Background
===========
In the development of technology architecture then be made to the TCP / IP is based on the seven layer OSI reference model, but using the reference model DARPA. As in the above diagram, the TCP / IP mengimplemenasikan layered architecture composed of four layers.
These four layers, can be mapped (albeit indirect) of the OSI reference model. These four layers, sometimes referred to as DARPA Model, Model Internet, or DoD Model, considering TCP / IP. besides it was made too OSI is a communication standard that is applied in a computer network. Standard that causes the entire communication devices can communicate with each other over the network. OSI reference model (Open Systems Interconnection) illustrates how information from a software application on a computer is moved across a network medium to a software application in another computer. OSI reference model is conceptually divided into seven layers where each layer has a specific network functions. Model Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which provides a structured framework of the logic of how the process of interacting data communication over a network. Standards were developed for the computer industry so that the computer can communicate on different networks efficiently.


**problem solution**
then we must use TCP / IP because TCP / IP is used in the World International, to mengembangakn technology may be TCP / IP is long but because of the ease of the offering will be used by those who pursue the technology.


**Conclusions and recommendations**
TCP / IP is very important to learn to know the network standards that we use, certainly not melupaka OSI Layer is where the basic learning.
To develop this all there must be teachers who can teach in detail so that someone much more knowledgeable
