**Background**

Anatomy of Hacking (Hacking Anatomy) are steps sequentially performed in the process of Hacking. Anatomy Hacking used to withstand hacker attacks aimed at negatively on our network security system. Therefore, structured steps will further facilitate the protection of the assets of the organization effectively and efficiently.

**Steps in Hacking Anatomy includes:**

Reconnaissance
scanning
Gaining Access
maintaining Access
Clearing Tracks
For rician about the steps in the Anatomy hacking will be presented as described below.

Steps

In this chapter will explain what are the steps in the following Hacking Anatomy explanation of each step and example.

Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance grammatically meaningful "Surveillance" is mapped to specific networks and explore a network. This attack was carried out to find the weak spots on the network that will be the victim. In this step, the success of a determined hacker how rigor in learning all about the network that will be targeted victims and seek as much information. In this step, there is not a form of disruption to the victim network.

There are two forms of activities undertaken in this reconnaissance measures, among others:

Passive Reconnaissance: Event monitor data through computer networks, analyze and draw conclusions from the information obtained without changing the data packets. Example: Sniffing, and Information Gathering
Active Reconnaissance: Event to gain access to the information system network by searching for the target system. Usually involving port scanning, firewall or router. The process of system utilization then performed after a hacker has found a way to access the system. Example: Accessing host, look for ports, the location of the router, and details of the OS used.
scanning
Stages of pre-attack where hackers gather network information that is more specific than the victims of the previous step Reconnaissance. Scanning can be analogized as a thief looking for doors or windows that can be penetrated. Scanning can also be interpreted as a form of detection system is still alive and can be accessed via the internet and what services are offered. This stage is a high risk, if the hacker can find the weaknesses of a system, then the hacker can exploit this network.

Examples of activities carried Hacker in this step include: Ping Sweeps, Port Scanning, and others.

Gaining Access
Is the most important step of attacking in terms of potential damage, although hackers do not always have access to the system to cause damage.

Factors that affect the likelihood of an attacker gaining access to the system, including the architecture and configuration, user and admin level skills, and access levels.

Examples of activities carried Hacker in this step include: BufferOverFlows, DoS (Denial of Service), Session Hijacking, and others.

maintaining Access
After Hackers gained access to the network of victims, in this step Hacker master the system and trying to maintain the "Ownership of the system that has been mastered, which means that hackers have successfully exploited the weakness of the victim system. In other words, hackers have taken over the system. Here also Hackers can establish a defense for the system that has been in the "have" it can not be taken back by the administrator or other hacker who also wants to get his access to the network system.

Organizations can also do defense attacked using intrus detection system (IDS) or deploy Honeypots and Honeynets to detect Hacker. In this case, the Organization ahrus have professional security necessary to take advantage of the protection concept.

Examples of activities carried Hacker in this step include: backdooring, rootkits, Trojans, Backdoors and Trojan Horse.

Clearing Attacks
Step where Hacker remove or clean the traces, evidence of the presence, and activities for the system the victim feels there is something wrong and also of course to maintain access to a system that has been taken over and avoid detection.

Examples of activities carried Hacker in this step include: Steganography, Tunneling, delete log files, etc.

**CONCLUSION**

Â In Anatomy of Hacking, contains measures that are required in hacking activity that can be done in a coherent and detailed. Many ways are done in every step in the Anatomy of Hacking, which is very varied so it would be quite difficult to overcome. Therefore, the Network Administrator is required to fast and responsive in the face of threats Hackers can attack at any time and in various ways or techniques vary.
