**Background**
 

"Denial of Service (DoS) attack" is an attempt (in the form of attacks) to paralyze the targeted system so that the system can not provide service-serve (denial of service) or the level of service has dropped even further. How to immobilize may vary and consequently can vary. The system under attack may be "stunned" (hangs, crashes), not functioning or down performance (because of high CPU load).
     This attack is different from data theft crimes or crimes monitor inforamasi passing. In a DoS attack nothing was stolen, but this can lead to financial loss. For example, if the system is under attack is the server that handles the transaction "commerce", then when the server is not working, the transaction can not take place. Imagine if a bank was attacked by a rival bank with crippling outlet ATM (Automatic Teller Machine, Automatic Teller Machine) which is owned by the bank. Or a credit card merchant server is under attack, so it can not accept payment by credit card.
In addition, DoS attacks are often used as part of another attack. For example, in an attack IPspoofing (as the attacks come from other places with the IP number belonging to someone else), is often used to stifle server DoS to be spoofed.

    DOS ATTACK CLASSIFICATION
Denial Of Service Attack is a most frequently used than the other attacks, this is because easy it is to do so, his exploits found on the internet too much. Anyone can download right down a website by simply using a simple command prompt. The main purpose of this attack is to create a system crash due to overload and so inaccessible or turn off the service.

Several classifications DoS attacks:
1. Land Attack
Land attack is an attack on the system by using a program called "land". Program land attack destination server by sending fake packets that appear to come from the destination server. In other words, the source and destination of the packet is made as though it came from the destination server. As a result, the attacked server becomes confused.
2. Latierra
Latierra program is a "refinement" of the land program, where the port used fickle making it difficult for security.
3. Ping Broadcast (Smurf)
One mechanism that attacks have recently begun to bloom is to use a ping to the broadcast address, this is often called a smurf. The entire computer (device), which is the broadcast address will be answered. If a system has many computers (device) and a broadcast ping is carried out continuously, the network can be satisfied by the responses of peripheral devices. As a result, the network is slow.
4. Ping of Death (PoD)
Ping-o-death is actually a ping program exploitation by providing a large size packet to the destination system. Some UNIX systems turned out to be a hang when attacked in this way. Ping programs commonly found in a variety of operating systems, although generally the ping program sends the packet to the small size of (certain) and does not have the facility to adjust the packet. One implementation of the ping program that can be used to change the size of the packet is a ping program in Windows 95 system.

**problem solution**
Denial of service is a method that has been desperately trying various data. The workings of denial service is a regular register set to exceed the service capacity server service so that the server can not serve other requests. In deniel of service there called Distributor DOS. Distributor DOS is Kumpulam the person doing DOS.
The capacity of Web services can be exemplified by X. If Petrik membuuat request by X then spongebob armpits served, but the server is still alive just busy serving Petrik.


What needs to be prepared attacker:
1. Only req much x
2. If you can not reach x then call friends join denagn friends and formed a DOS distributor.


**Conclusion**
                Conclusion Denial of service is a method that has been desperately trying various data. The workings of denial service is a regular register set to exceed the service capacity server service so that the server can not serve other requests. Due to denial of service servers can be attacked by several times with one pc.

**Suggestion**
            More increase knowledge and find other references to the material practice of denial of service. because denail of service is very important in securing the attacker or a server or website.
