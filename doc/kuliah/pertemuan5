**Background**

Spoofing is a "technique used to gain unauthorized access to a computer or information, which an attacker associated with the user by pretending to falsify that they are hosts to be believed" this is usually done by a hacker / cracker.

Macam-Macam Spoofing
IP-Spoofing is a complex technical attack yant consists of several components. It is a security exploit that works by tricking computers in a trust relationship that you are someone else. There are many papers written by daemon9, route, and infinity in the Volume Seven, Issue fourty-Eight Phrack magazine.
DNS spoofing is taking the DNS name of another system with a domain name server jeopardize a legitimate domain.
Identify Spoofing is an act of intrusion by using official identity illegally. By using this identity, the intruder will be able to access anything on the network.

Examples of Web Spoofing
Web Spoofing involves a web server that is owned by an attacker who is put on the Internet between users with WWW, so access to the webpage that the user is going through a server the attacker. This way is known as the "man in the middle attack" [2,5]. This can occur with some roads, but most likely are:
Access to the website is routed through a proxy server: this is called (HTTP) application proxy. This provides better network management access to the server. This is a pretty good technique that is used on many websites on the internet, but this technique does not prevent site spoofing.
Someone put a false link (which is already hacked) on popular web pages.
We use search engines (search engines, such as Yahoo, Alta Vista, Goggle) to get a link from the topics you want to search. Without our knowledge, some of these links have been placed by a hacker who pretend to be someone else. Such as, the search for the bank's website provides one of the results http: //www.kilkbca..com, unfortunately we may not know that the actual URL of Bank BCA is http://www.klikbca.com
We use a browser to access the Web. Everything on the NET (either Internet or Intranet) referenced by the Universal Resource Locator (URL). First the attacker must rewrite the URL of the destination web page so that they refer to a server owned by the attacker rather than to the actual web server. For example, the server is located in www.attacker.com attacker, the attacker will rewrite the URL by adding http://www.attacker.com front of the original URL.

**problem solution**

            Spoofing is the process of giving false addresses to the victim so that the victim will follow the fake address. Suppose the attacker has type A 66.25.xx.xx IP address when the attacker perform these types of attacks that attacked the network will assume the attacker IP is part of their network, eg IP type C. 192.xx.xx.xx ie IP Spoofing occurs when an attacker ' outsmart 'packet routing to change the direction of the data or transmissions to different destinations. Packet routing is usually transmitted in a transparent and clear so as to make the attacker to easily modify data origin or destination of the data. This technique is not only used by the attacker but also be used by security professionals to download tracing the identity of the attacker.
            Types Spoofing:
1. ARP Spoofing
ARP Spoofing is Deceiving victims by providing a fake MAC address.
2. DNS Spoofing
DNS Spoofing is Deceiving victims by providing fake IP.

Explanation of the picture above
1. A wants to communicate to the internet so that A must pass through the router R to get to the internet.
2. A can lead to the router R to view the table of alternative herself
3. A B wants to cheat so as not up to the Internet by giving a false table.
4. So A look at the table thought the fake items B and B is a router, an automatic flow towards the internet disconnected.

How to cope:
1. Do not accept the table from anyone
2. Create a static table that can not be changed / updated


**Conclusion**

Conclusion Spoofing is the process of giving false addresses to the victim so that the victim will follow the fake address. So in opening a website address, we should view the certificate from the web, or can be checked through whois.domain because there can be seen a domain name or e-mail domain.

**Suggestion**

Be careful in the opening address of the website, you should first check the certificate of the website address we will open because it could lead to fraud and could be detrimental.
